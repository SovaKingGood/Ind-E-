For my capstone project at BCIT we are converting an old Indy race car to electric!

I am in charge of creating a custom motor controller to operate the induction motor.

This code uses a TI C2000 microcontroller to incorporate space vector modulation with min-max injection to rotate an induction motor using the V/f method.

Field Oriented Control coming soon.
